# About the Project

Our project is an observation-based card game, with two different playing modes, that challenge players to recall the order of three randomly numbered cards after they have been shuffled and hidden. The game combines elements of focus, observation, and time pressure to create an engaging and rewarding experience.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this project came from our fascination with observation games and cognitive challenges. We wanted to create a game that was simple to understand but difficult to master, appealing to a wide range of players. The idea of combining observation with a time constraint was particularly intriguing, as it adds an extra layer of excitement and urgency.

## Development Process

We started by outlining the core mechanics of the game and making a roadmap of how things would progress after a brainstorming session. We assigned one webpage to every member of the team. After completion, we merged all of these webpages with the main branch, thus resulting in the completion of our game.

## Challenges We Faced

One of the main challenges we faced was ensuring the shuffling mechanism was both random and visually trackable. We wanted players to feel they could follow the cards' movements without making it too easy. Balancing the difficulty level was another challenge, as we needed to make the game engaging for both casual and more competitive players. Additionally, implementing the timer without causing unnecessary stress was a key consideration.
